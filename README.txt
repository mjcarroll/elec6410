A repository for keeping DSP-related Projects.

The first project (Project 1) was before I had really mastered the whole LaTeX typesetting thing.  The later projects are a better example.

In each directory, there is an .m file using MATLAB's cell markup mode. There will also be a "latex" directory containing generated figures and tex files for the project.
